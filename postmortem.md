## Approach and Process
#### What in my process and approach to this project would I do differently next time?
#### My progress and approach
**Step 1**
 - Understanding the project scope and then brainstorming about the ideas.
 - The following ideas were as well under my considerations
	 - ***COVID-19 trend page***, inspired by https://againstcovid19.com/singapore/dashboard
		(However, it is more to extracting the data from database and make it interactive, there are too many similar pages like such).
	- ***Breakout Game***  (However, I studied the code for the canvas, it seem it beyond my capabilities at that moment.)

**Step 2**
 - Decided on the project, and start drafted out wireframe directly using CSS and HTML.
 
**Step 3**
 - Drafted few levels (4) and asked peers to feedback to see whether the game is playable or not before fully coded for all 10 levels. Mobile support already linked.
 
**Step 4**
- Review the feedbacks and make necessary changes and keep the review progress ongoing before final submission. 

#### What I would do differently next time

**CSS**
-	Currently my CSS are not refactored, and most are them are repeated. I shall add one class to the repeated CSS and added to the JS or HTML. 

**HTML**
-	I shall be more consistent, either all HTML or all DOM manipulation through Jquery. 


### What in my process and approach to this project went well that I would repeat next time?
 - Getting feedback is something useful to improve on the user stories especially on the UI interaction as I improved my UI and logic a lot after getting the feedbacks.

## Code and Code Design

### What in my code and program design in the project would I do differently next time?
- To use class or prototype, this seems to be more structured than my current code even though I have made it modular by levels, it is not fully refactored. I would like to make my html code modular as well, but I not sure how that possible. 

### What in my code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything I would do the same next time?â€™
- Modular the files, as this helps in term of debugging.

## Unit 1 Post Mortem

**1.	What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?**
- Googled and watched Youtube for the ways to code for specific functions I wanted e.g. progress timebar, draggable and droppable, etc. 

**2.	What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?**
- Refactor, I think I shall improve on the refactoring the codes using class or prototype. 

**3.	How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)**
- The course materials and instructions in Unit are fine overall for all.
